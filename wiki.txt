cells the disease model tested was a mouse model of human lung cancer results showed enhanced antitumor activity and significant reduction of exposure of healthy organs when compared to the conventional intravenous treatment self powered nanoparticles with a payload of osteoporosis drug are reported to be pulled ion gradients generated by leaked minerals ions from the bone and deliver highly targeted drugs for healing using a model system of human tibia and femur researchers from pennsylvania state university and boston university used nanoparticles of polylactic coglycolic acid widely used in medical devices carrying sodium alendronate an osteoporosis drug for the in vitro experiments and found the nanotrucks successfully carry the drug to the fresh crack of the human bone nanodiamond is diamond particle with a diameter of 2 to 8 nm and surface functional groups to bind various kinds of molecule clusters of the nanodiamonds in the range of 50 100 nm in diameter can be manufactured to trap drug inside and slowly release the payload experiments by researchers in northwestern university on mouse models with chemotherapy resistant liver and breast cancers show that the nanodiamonds with a normally lethal dose of doxorubicin significantly reduce the size of the tumors without toxic side effects expected from the drug if administered alone the nanodiamond drug complex is found to have a much longer and once inside the tumor the nanoparticles are retained much longer additional studies using nanodiamonds include treating the triple negative breast cancer with epirubicin and glioblastoma with doxorubicin increase in survival rate with reduced side effects were observed in both the mouse models ucla reported that contact lens embedded with nanodiamonds at the size of 5 nm in diameter and loaded with the glaucoma drug timolol maleate allow controlled and sustained release of the medicine the nanodiamonds were combined with the polymer chitosan which is cleaved when the lens make contact with the lysozyme in tears the drug releases slowly in the eyes when the nanodiamond structure breaks down in regenerative medicine research silica based nanoparticles are used to deliver molecules to transplanted cells derived from stem cells using a mouse model scientists delivered two synthetic versions of neurotrophic growth factors locally using mesoporous nanoparticles to motor neurons derived from transplanted embryonic stem cells and reported improved long term survival and functional differentiation of the transplant in vivo nanoparticle with a liposomal core and a gel to shrink breast cancer tumor in a mouse model researchers in the north carolina state university designed this nanoparticle called gelipo to deliver both drugs simultaneously and maximize the efficiency of both the cross linked hyaluronic acid ha shell holds and protects the tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand trail while the core carries liposomes filled with doxorubicin embedded with peptide ha preferentially concentrates in hyaluronidase haase rich tumor environment and interacts with receptors on the cancer cell membranes when the haase degrades the gel shell of gelipo the trail protein is released onto the cell membrane and triggers apoptosis cell death the core liposomes are internalized by the tumor cells into endosomes the cellular transport system the peptide breaks down the endosome and releases doxorubicin intracellularly maximizes the efficacy while minimizes the toxic side effects protein and peptide delivery protein and peptides exert multiple biological actions in the human body and they have been identified as showing great promise for treatment of various diseases and disorders these macromolecules are using nanomaterials like nanoparticles and dendrimers is an emerging field called nanobiopharmaceutics and these products are called nanobiopharmaceuticals applications and reported research studies nanoparticles delivering the myelin antigens were found to induce immune tolerance in a mouse model with relapsing multiple sclerosis biodegradable polystyrene microparticles coated with the myelin sheath peptides reset the mouse s immune system and prevent the disease from recurring or reduce the symptoms by halting the attack of the immune system to the protective myelin sheath coating the nerve fibers of the central nervous system team of researchers in northwestern university indicated that this treatment method can potentially be used in other autoimmune diseases researchers at ucla developed a nanoparticle system with water soluble shell encapsulated a protein derived from bird anemia virus apoptin apoptin selectively sends self destruct signal to tumor cells and trigger the programmed cell death apoptosis as it builds up in the nucleus while leaving healthy cells unharmed in the mouse model of human breast cancer the treatment was found to significantly reduce the tumors growth this new form of treatment harming healthy cells a common pitfall of chemotherapy and no probability of genetic mutation that usually accompanies gene therapy a nano network of nanoparticles with a solid core of insulin modified dextran and glucose oxidase was demonstrated to be able to regulate and maintain normal blood sugar level in a mouse model with type 1 diabetes for up to 10 days the nanoparticle is coated with either the positively charged chitosan from shrimp shells or negatively charged alginate from seaweed the opposite charges hold the nanoparticles together as a nano network even after they are injected subcutaneously the porous particles allow blood to make contact with the nanoparticle cores when there is high blood sugar level glucose oxidase is activated and breaks down the dextran into gluconic acid the disintegration of the cores releases the insulin which controls the blood sugar level to the normal range cancer the small size of nanoparticles endows them with properties that can be very useful in oncology particularly in imaging quantum dots nanoparticles with quantum confinement properties in conjunction with mri magnetic resonance imaging can produce exceptional images of tumor sites these nanoparticles are much brighter than organic dyes and only need one light source for excitation this means that the use of fluorescent quantum dots could produce a higher contrast image and at a lower cost than today s organic dyes used as contrast media the downside however is that quantum dots are usually made of quite toxic elements another nanoproperty high surface area to volume ratio allows many functional groups to be attached to a nanoparticle which can seek out and bind to certain tumor cells additionally the small size of nanoparticles 10 to 100 nanometers allows them to preferentially accumulate at tumor sites because tumors lack an effective lymphatic drainage system research into multifunctional nanoparticles that would detect image and then proceed to treat a tumor is under way a promising new cancer treatment that may one day replace radiation and chemotherapy is edging closer to human trials kanzius rf therapy inside the body with radio waves that heat only the nanoparticles and the adjacent cancerous cells sensor test chips containing thousands of nanowires able to detect proteins and other biomarkers left behind by cancer cells could enable the detection and diagnosis of cancer in the early stages from a few drops of a patient s blood the basic point to use drug delivery is based upon three facts a efficient encapsulation of the drugs b successful delivery of said drugs to the targeted region of the body and c successful release of that drug there researchers at rice university under prof jennifer west have demonstrated the use of 120 nm diameter nanoshells coated with gold to kill cancer tumors in mice the nanoshells can be targeted to bond to cancerous cells by conjugating antibodies or peptides to the nanoshell surface by irradiating the area of the tumor with an infrared laser which passes through flesh without heating it the gold is heated sufficiently to cause death to the cancer cells limitations to and lack of solubility nanoparticles have the potential to overcome these problems nanoparticles of cadmium selenide quantum dots glow when exposed to ultraviolet light when injected they seep into cancer tumors the surgeon can see the glowing tumor and use it as a guide for more accurate tumor removal in photodynamic therapy a particle is placed within the body and is illuminated with light from the outside the light gets absorbed by the particle and if the particle is metal energy from the light will heat the particle and surrounding tissue light may also be used to produce high energy oxygen molecules which will chemically react with and destroy most organic molecules that are next to them like tumors this therapy is appealing for many reasons it does not leave a toxic trail of reactive molecules throughout the body chemotherapy because it is directed where only the light is shined and the particles exist photodynamic therapy has potential for a noninvasive procedure for dealing with diseases growth and tumors numerous therapeutic functions into a single platform by targeting specific tumor cells tissues and organs actually conde et al reported the evaluation of the inflammatory response and therapeutic sirna silencing via rgd nanoparticles in a lung cancer mouse model this study reported the use of sirna rgd gold nanoparticles capable of targeting tumor cells in two lung cancer xenograft mouse models resulting in successful and significant c myc oncogene downregulation followed by tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival of the animals this delivery system can achieve translocation of sirna duplexes directly into the tumour cell cytoplasm and accomplish successful silencing of an oncogene expression actually rgd sirna aunps can target preferentially and be taken up by tumor cells via integrin v3 receptor mediated endocytosis with no cytotoxicity showing that can accumulate in tumor tissues overexpressing v3 integrins and selectively delivered c myc sirna to suppress tumor growth and angiogenesis surgery at rice university a flesh welder is used to fuse two pieces of chicken meat into a single piece the two pieces of chicken are placed dribbled along the seam an infrared laser is traced along the seam causing the two sides to weld together this could solve the difficulties and blood leaks caused when the surgeon tries to restitch the arteries that have been cut during a kidney or heart transplant the flesh welder could weld the artery perfectly visualization tracking movement can help determine how well drugs are being distributed or how substances are metabolized it is difficult to track a small group of cells throughout the body so scientists used to dye the cells these dyes needed to be excited by light of a certain wavelength in order for them to light up while different color dyes absorb different frequencies of light there was a need for as many light sources as cells a way around this problem is with luminescent tags these tags are quantum dots attached to proteins that penetrate cell membranes the dots can be random in size can be made of bio inert material and they demonstrate the nanoscale property that color is size dependent the frequency of light used to make a group of quantum dots fluoresce is an even multiple of the frequency required to make another group incandesce then both groups can be lit with a single light source they have also found a way to insert nanoparticles into the affected parts of the body so that those parts of the body will glow showing the tumor growth or shrinkage or also organ trouble tissue engineering nanotechnology may be able to help reproduce or repair damaged tissue tissue engineering makes use of artificially stimulated cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterial based scaffolds and growth factors for example bones could be regrown on carbon nanotube scaffolds tissue engineering might replace today s conventional treatments like organ transplants or artificial implants advanced forms of tissue engineering may lead to life extension artificial bone composites are also being manufactured from nanocrystalline calcium phosphates antimicrobial effects nanoparticles can be used in combination therapy for decreasing antibiotic resistance or for their antimicrobial properties it has been shown that zinc oxide nanoparticles can decrease the antibiotic in vitro nanoparticles can interfere with the different proteins which are interacting in the antibiotic resistance or pharmacologic mechanisms of drugs another example is silver which has been used for the treatment of burns and chronic wounds antibacterial and antifungal properties of nanoparticles have widened their applications in medicine and dentistry immune response buckyballs have been investigated for the ability to interrupt the allergy immune response by preventing mast cells which cause allergic response from releasing histamine into the blood and tissues by binding to free radicals dramatically better than any anti oxidant currently available such as vitamin e in february 2013 university of pennsylvania researchers developed a way to prevent nano particles from triggering an immune system response which could aid the delivery of medicinal nanoparticles some time in future this is done by using the protein cd47 found on most mammalian cell membranes which binds to the sirpa in macrophages preventing an immune response from being triggered arthroscope nanotechnology is helping to advance the use of arthroscopes which are pencil sized devices that can do the surgeries with smaller incisions the smaller the incisions the faster the healing time which is better for the patients it is also helping to find a way to make an arthroscope smaller than a strand of hair diagnostic and medical devices nanotechnology on a chip is one more dimension of lab on a chip technology magnetic nanoparticles bound to a suitable antibody are used to label specific molecules structures or microorganisms gold nanoparticles tagged with short segments of dna can be used for detection of genetic sequence in a sample multicolor optical coding for biological assays has been achieved by embedding different sized quantum dots into polymeric microbeads nanopore technology for analysis of nucleic acids converts strings of nucleotides directly into electronic signatures c dots cornell dots are the smallest silica based nanoparticles with the size 62628 7509 10 scriptstyle x is given and the cost function to be minimized that can be any function of the data scriptstyle x and the network s output scriptstyle f the cost function is dependent on the task a priori assumptions the implicit properties of our model its parameters and the observed variables as a trivial example consider the model scriptstyle f x a where scriptstyle a is a constant and the cost scriptstyle c e x f x 2 minimizing this cost will give us a value of scriptstyle a that is equal to the mean of the data the cost function can be much more complicated its form depends on the application for example in compression it could be related to the mutual information between scriptstyle x and scriptstyle f x whereas in statistical modeling it could be related to the posterior probability of the model given the data note that in both of those examples those quantities would be maximized rather than minimized tasks that fall within the paradigm of unsupervised learning are in general estimation problems
